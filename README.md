In This Repository, I have created a tic-tac-toe web application Game.

Tic-Tac-Toe:-
At first,for game-essential things, I coded with HTML.
I created styles with CSS for the appearance of the game.
I used JavaScript for the game functionality.

It is a game for two players.

It is usually played on a 3x3 board.

The player who started first fills in the empty squares by typing ‘X’ and the other player ‘O’.

A player wins the game when they X-X-X or O-O-O in rows, columns, or diagonals.

If all squares filled and were provided one from the above conditions,then the game is tied.
